Question Summary : 
    - There are n no of posts 1 to n
    - stream of m likes for posts
    - for each like of post p 
        if p is highest : nothing
        else order of post p is swapped by one just above it
    - find min and max pos for every post

Constraints :
 1 <= n,m <= 10^5

Solution :

1.  - maintain min max and cur pos for all posts
    - for every like update pos for the two posts affected by the like
    - output min max for all posts
    complexity = O(m+n)
